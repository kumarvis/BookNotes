# **DO EPIC SHIT** - by Ankur Warikoo

## Book Summary:
Writer Ankur Warikoo has put his deep, witty and brutally honest thoughts on success and failure, money and investing, self-awareness and personal relationships.

&nbsp;

### 1. `People do not have to follow up, when you commit to doing something.`

Most of us take the above line mostly in Professional Context and the writer has put it in the same context for us. I feel we should extend it to personal life also. If you commit something to your Wife, Son just because they are your family, taking leverage is not good.

&nbsp;

### 2. `We know ourselves through our thoughts. But we know others through their actions.`
Turn the table for a while and imagine how we felt when a commitment made by a salesperson, maid, boss or even our close friends and family couldn’t be fulfilled. In this situation no matter what they think about you in their head, what really matters for YOU or ME is the ACTION TAKEN. Hence Commitments are Nothing if Not Backed up with Actions.

&nbsp;

### 3. `The world is going to treat you how it wishes to treat you. You don’t control that.`

&nbsp;

### 4. `If you don’t ask, the Answer is Always NO. Specially in corporate setup, “Asking is the best thing to do before making assumptions”.`

&nbsp;

### 5. `Doing the things that are the Most Important are the things that Make you important.`

What makes me important in my new work environment?

1. Get hold of code
2. Ease the process
3. Innovate

- How to implement the above idea: Make a WEEKLY list of the tasks which are important for your workplace. Make sure you DISCUSS and Execute them successfully.


### 6.`Fear has led to more procrastination than laziness ever will. You don’t procrastinate because you are lazy. You procrastinate because you are scared.`

Personally I'm scared when I have to run my final code on a BIG dataset which leads to unnecessary Procrastination. Also if procrastinate early failure will be delayed resulting in buggy code. 

- SOLUTION01: Test on Small Dataset  multiple times it will help to eliminate obvious bugs and crashes. Code will be much more bug free for BIG DATASET/ LONG Training etc . 

- SOLUTION02: In case of an ambiguous task or a work with no interest, think of the POMODORO technique just AIM for 1-2 POMODORO. 

### 7. `The best way to get help is to make it easier for people to help you. Be specific as much as you can. Ask Where and Why  you need help to figure out SPECIFIC Question.`
