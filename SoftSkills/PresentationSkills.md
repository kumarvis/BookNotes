> ## How to start a Presentation:

Below are the few ways that is consider as a good practice to start your Presentation.

1. Start with an empowerment promise, what audience are going to know at the end of the hr, they dont know right now.

2. Put a fact that shocks audience. 

3. **WHY + STORY**, Start with a story the way we narrate to child i.e "Once Upon a Time" now there is a grown up way to say this. Few examples:

- Yesterday I was having a conversation with "xyz" person regarding ..

- Last month I was reading/watching an intresting article/book/video ..

    and answer the **"WHY"** question. Why it is important for the audience to listen this topic or you. Use time frame in your story example yesterday, last month and preferabbly put a story which happend/exprienced by YOU.

4. Linking line to story and goal: <ins> "Why do I tell you this story because my objective/goal with this presenstation is to ... "</ins>

> ## Repetition is your friend:
1. Starting: Put your idea/message in a brief manner with fewer points.
2. Middle: Explain your idea in detail with images, videos etc. backed with data
chart etc.
3. End: Summaries/revise the KEY points.
