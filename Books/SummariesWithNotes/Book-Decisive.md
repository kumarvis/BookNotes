# **DECISIVE** - by Chip and Dan Heath

## Book Summary:

Book talks about a structured or a rule based process which can lead us to better decision maker in our Personal and Professional life. The author called this PROCESS **WRAP**.
The process WRAP consist of below steps.

### 1. Problem of narrow framing:

- A very common decision-making trap is “Narrow Framing,” we don't tend to explore the option that we can or broaden our option. Author even goes further and comments that we often make our decision by comparing option-1 **OR** option-2. Author said in most cases by broadening the option and more drilling down you will amazed to see you can choose option-1 **AND** option-2.

- In most decision making dilemmas you can always find a person who has already faced a similar situation. The author called it, "Finding the bright spot". 

- Consider the exact opposite of your decision. Example if you want to buy some expensive car or home what are the repercussions, and analyse the situation what if you don't do that. Write down the pros and cons for both the cases.

- Reality test your assumption, before jumping for a full-fledged solution which you think is the right decision, run a small pilot program, "**dip a toe in your decision without diving in headfirst**".

### 2. Short term emotion:

- We all have short term emotional sense which dominate the long term value decision. Author suggests to follow the **10/10/10** rule. Think how relevant or value your decision holds after 10 minutes, then 10 months and 10 years. This simple analysis will safeguard us from impulsive short term emotional decision making.

### 3. False sense of certainty:

- We humans are very bad in prediction, in an example when university students were sure they were wrong only 1% of the time actually their prediction was wrong 27% of the time. When we predict a certain task will be completed in **X** amount of time, most of the time our estimate is not even close to actual time taken to complete the task. Psychologists called it **Confirmation Bias**. Author suggest to have apply a cushion factor of min 1.3 in your prediction.Example the escalator have cushion factor of 6 that means if it is written it can carry 10 tons of weight in actually escalator is design to take care of til 60 tons.

### 4. Future is not a point its range:

Whenever you try to predict the future, don't look at it as a point where you have to reach. Rather consider the spectrum of possibilities and take the future as a range.
